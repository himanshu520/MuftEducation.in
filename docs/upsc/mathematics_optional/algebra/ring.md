A ring $R$ is a set with two binary operations, addition (denoted by $a + b$) and multiplication (denoted by $ab$), such that for all $a, b, c$ in $R$:

1. $a + b = b + a$. 
2. $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.
3. There is an additive identity $0$. That is, there is an element $0$ in $R$ such that $a + 0 = a$ for all $a$ in $R$.
4. There is an element $-a$ in $R$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.
5. $a(bc) = (ab)c$.
6. $a(b + c) = ab + ac \text{ and } (b + c) a = ba + ca$.

So, a ring is an Abelian group under addition, also having an asso-
ciative multiplication that is left and right distributive over addition.
Note that multiplication need not be commutative. When it is, we say
that the ring is commutative. Also, a ring need not have an identity under multiplication. A unity (or identity) in a ring is a nonzero element
that is an identity under multiplication. A nonzero element of a com-
mutative ring with unity need not have a multiplicative inverse. When it
does, we say that it is a unit of the ring. Thus, $a$ is a unit if $a^{-1}$ exists.

The following terminology and notation are convenient. If $a$ and $b$ belong to a commutative ring $R$ and $a$ is nonzero, we say that $a$ divides $b$ (or that $a$ is a factor of $b$) and write $a | b$, if there exists an element $c$ in $R$ such that $b = ac$. If a does not divide $b$, we write $a \not | b$.

Recall that if $a$ is an element from a group under the operation of
addition and $n$ is a positive integer, $na$ means $a + a + \cdots + a$, where
there are $n$ summands. When dealing with rings, this notation can cause
confusion, since we also use juxtaposition for the ring multiplication. When there is the potential for confusion, we will use $n \cdot a$ to mean $a + a + \cdots + a$ ($n$ summands).
